# **Gatekeeper:** An Authentication & Authorization Library

## Introduction

**[Find Gatekeeper on GitHub](https://github.com/psecio/gatekeeper)**

The [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/psecio/gatekeeper) library is a simple drop-in library that can be used to manage users, permissions and groups for
your application. The goal is to make securing your application as simple as possible while still providing a solid and
secure foundation to base your user system around.

*Gatekeeper* is best classified as a Role-Base Access Control (RBAC) system with users, groups and permissions. It is
framework-agnostic and is set up to use its own database for the user handling.

*Gatekeeper* provides a standard NIST Level 2 Role Based Access Control system that also includes support for child permissions and child groups supported in a tree structure.
